We present measurements of the $\cos\phi_h$ and $\cos2\phi_h$ moments and the $\phi_h$-independent term of the semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) cross-section in charged pion production.
The data set was collected using a 5.498 GeV longitudinally polarized electron beam and an unpolarized liquid hydrogen target.
Final state particles were detected with the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS) at Jefferson Lab.
Positive and negative pion production was studied over a broad kinematical range ($x = 0.1 - 0.6$, $Q^2 = 1.0 - 4.5\ \text{GeV}^2$, $z = 0.0 - 0.9$, $P_{h\perp}^2 = 0.0 - 1.0\ \text{GeV}^2$, and $-180^\circ < \phi_h < 180^\circ$).
These measurements give insights into the transverse momentum dependence of parton distribution functions (PDFs) describing the dynamics of quarks and gluons inside of the proton.

\textbf{I. INTRODUCTION} \par
\end{center}
In recent years parton distribution functions have been generalized to contain information not only on the longitudinal momentum but also on the transverse momentum distributions of partons in a fast moving hadron.
Intense theoretical investigations of Transverse Momentum Dependent (TMD) distributions of partons and the first unambiguous experimental signals of TMDs indicate that QCD-dynamics inside hadrons is  much richer than what can be learned from collinear parton distributions.
It is expected that TMDs will give model dependent insights into quark orbital motion and its contribution to the proton spin.

TMDs depend on the three-dimensional momentum of a particular parton inside of a hadron.
Semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) is the foremost tool for accessing TMDs and has emerged as a powerful tool to probe nucleon structure through measurements of spin and azimuthal asymmetries.
A SIDIS reaction is one in which a beam lepton, $\ell$, is scattered off a target nucleon, $N$, and is detected in coincidence with a hadron, $h$.
The reaction may be written as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sidis}
\ell (k) + N(P) \rightarrow \ell^{\prime} (k^{\prime} ) + h(P_{h}) + X(P_{X})
\end{equation}
where $k$, $P$, $k^{\prime}$, $P_{h}$, and $P_{X}$ are the 4-momenta of the unpolarized incident lepton, target nucleon, scattered lepton, hadron, and any other particles, respectively.

The final-state gluon radiation in SIDIS was predicted to lead to non-zero $\cos\phi_h$ modulations of the SIDIS cross section,
where $\phi_h$ is the azimuthal angle of final state hadrons with respect to the lepton scattering plane as defined by the Trento convention~\cite{Bacchetta:2004jz},
and that effect has been  proposed by Georgi and Politzer in  1977~\cite{Georgi:1977tv}  as a clean test of pQCD.
This is a next-to-leading order effect in the strong coupling constant and contributes mainly at large values of $\Phperp$, where $\Phperp$ is the transverse momentum component of the final state hadron with respect to the virtual photon.

In 1978, Cahn~\cite{Cahn:1978se}   discussed  similar asymmetries arising from non-zero intrinsic transverse momenta of partons.
Although suppressed by $P_{h\perp}/Q$, where $Q$ is defined by $Q^2 = -q^2 = -(k-k^\prime)^2$ where $q$ is the four-momentum of the virtual photon, that modulation (known as the Cahn effect) appeared to be significant and dominating in the $P_{h\perp} \sim $1 GeV range.
Significant cosine modulations of $\phi_h$, observed in various experiments, indicate that higher twist~\cite{Jaffe:1996zw} effects can be very important.
Additional contributions to $\cos \phi_h$ and $\cos 2\phi_h$ moments coming from processes where the final meson
is produced at short distances via hard-gluon exchange \cite{Berger:1979xz} may also be 
significant in the kinematic regime where the ejected meson carries  most of 
the virtual photon momentum.

The spin-orbit correlations between the parton transverse momentum and spin, known as the Boer-Mulders effect~\cite{Boer:1997nt}, can generate a leading-twist
contribution to the $\cos 2\phi_h$ modulation, which is one of the main focuses of our studies.
The Boer-Mulders function, discussed in the next section, is of particular interest since it vanishes in the absence of transverse momentum and thus gives insights into the quark angular momentum contribution to the proton spin.

This work reports measurements of the $\phi_h$-independent term ($A_0$) and azimuthal moments ($A^{\cos \phi_h}_{UU}$ and $A^{\cos \phi_h}_{UU}$) of the unpolarized SIDIS cross-section for charged pions in a fully differential way using a 5.498 GeV electron beam at the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS) \cite{Mecking:2003zu} at Jefferson Lab.
Only a few measurements of the spin-independent cross-section's azimuthal dependence in semi-inclusive DIS experiments have been published in the past~\cite{Aubert:1983cz,Arneodo:1986cf,Adams:1993hs,Breitweg:2000qh}.
Most measurements averaged over any possible flavour dependence as they refer to hadrons without type nor charge distinction, and only to hydrogen target or hydrogen and deuterium targets combined together.

\textbf{II. FORMALISM} \par
\end{center}
Assuming single photon exchange, the leptoproduction cross-section for an unpolarized beam and unpolarized target can be written as a sum of structure functions (\cite{Bacchetta:2006tn}):
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:crosssection3}
\begin{split}
& \frac{d^{5} \sigma}{dx\ dQ^2\ dz\ d \phi_{h}\ dP_{h \perp}^{2}} =
\\
& \frac{2\pi}{2(k\cdot P)x} \frac{\alpha^{2}}{xyQ^{2}} \frac{y^{2}}{2 \left( 1 - \varepsilon \right)} \left( 1 + \frac{\gamma^{2}}{2x} \right) \times
\\
& \left\{ F_{UU,T} + \varepsilon F_{UU,L} + \sqrt{2 \varepsilon \left( 1 + \varepsilon \right)} \cos \phi_{h} F^{\cos \phi_{h}}_{UU} + \right.
\\
& \left. \varepsilon \cos \left( 2 \phi_{h} \right) F_{UU}^{\cos2\phi_{h}} \right\},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where the structure functions, $F$, depend on kinematical variables $x,Q^2,z,P_{h\perp}$ and define the modulations of corresponding azimuthal moments with azimuthal angle $\phi_{h}$.
The first subscript on the structure functions represents the beam polarization, the second subscript represents the target polarization, and the third subscript (if there is one) represents the virtual photon polarization, where U, L, and T are short for unpolarized, longitudinally polarized, and transversely polarized, respectively.
The kinematic variables $\xbj$, $y$, and $z$  are defined as follows.
$\xbj = Q^2/{2(P\cdot q)}$ is the longitudinal momentum fraction of the struck quark, 
$y={(P \cdot q)/(P \cdot k)}$ is the fraction of the beam energy carried by the virtual photon,
and $\zh=(P_h \cdot P)/(P \cdot q)$ is the longitudinal momentum fraction of the struck quark, 
where $\gamma=2M\xbj /Q$ and $M$ and $M_h$ are the nucleon and hadron masses.
The ratio $\varepsilon$ of the longitudinal and transverse photon flux is given by: $\varepsilon=\frac{1-y-\gamma^2y^2/4}{1-y+y^2/2+\gamma^2y^2/4}$.
The structure function  $F_{UU,T}$  defining the $\phi_h$-integrated cross sections could be presented as a convolution of  distribution function (DF), $f_1$,   and fragmentation function (FF), $D_1$, which  are the usual unpolarized twist-2 DF and FF, respectively. 

The structure function $F^{\cos 2\ph}_{UU}$ at leading twist can be presented as a convolution of Boer-Mulders distribution function, $h_1^\perp$ \cite{Boer:1997nt} describing the correlation between the transverse motion
of a quark and its own transverse spin, and  the Collins fragmentation function, $H_1^{\perp}$~\cite{Collins:1992kk}, describing fragmentation of transversely polarized quarks.
The structure function $F^{\cos \ph}_{UU}$  receives contributions 
from the convolution of twist-2 and twist-3 distribution and fragmentation functions,
such as the twist-2 time-reversal odd Boer-Mulders DF $h_1^\perp$ (\cite{Boer:1997nt,Pasquini:2010af}), the Collins FF $H_1^{\perp}$, and the twist-3 DFs $h$ and $f^\perp$~\cite{Bacchetta:2006tn}.
Both functions represent spin-orbit correlations. 

The $\cos \phi_h$ modulation of the structure function $F_{UU}^{\cos \phi_h}$ in Eq.~\ref{eq:crosssection3} gets contributions only
at sub-leading level and suppressed by powers of the hard scale Q (higher-twist).
This type of contribution is interesting in its own as it provides complementary information
on the quark dynamics.

Among the various twist-3 contributions suppressed as $1/Q$, several involve
either a distribution or fragmentation function that relates to
quark-gluon-quark correlations, and hence is interaction dependent and has no probabilistic
interpretation. In the Wandzura-Wilczeck approximation~\cite{Wandzura:1977qf}
all these terms are neglected, and only two contributions are considered: %
\begin{eqnarray} \nonumber
\label{Eq:cosphi}
\FUUc & \simeq & -\frac{2M}{Q}\  C\left[\frac{ \hat{\bf h} \cdot \pt}{M} xf^\perp D_1 +
\frac{\hat{\bf h} \cdot \kt}{M_h} 
xh H_1^\perp \right] \\
\end{eqnarray}
where the first (second) term is related to the Cahn (Boer-Mulders) effect.
There are no contributions to $\FUUcc$ suppressed as $1/Q$ however a contribution suppressed as $1/Q^2$ is expected from the Cahn effect to $\FUUcc$.
Other contributions beyond $1/Q$ have not been calculated yet.
The structure function $F^{\cos \ph}_{UU}$ is higher-twist by nature, which means it can only be accessed at moderate values of $Q^2$.
%Such higher-twist observables are a key for understanding long-range quark-gluon dynamics.
They have also been interpreted in terms of average transverse forces acting on a quark at the instant after absorbing the virtual photon \cite{Burkardt:2008vd}.
Different contributions to the structure function  $F^{\cos \ph}_{UU}$ have been calculated, related to both internal quark motion and the Collins mechanisms.
Sizable modulations as large as $\left< \cos \phi_h \right> = 0.2$ were predicted for pion production~\cite{Anselmino:2005nn} with spin-orbit correlations as the dynamical origin.
Within this framework, the asymmetry generated at the distribution level is given by either the convolution of the T-odd Boer-Mulders DF $h_1^{\perp}$ with the twist-3 FF $\tilde{H}$ ~\cite{Bacchetta:2006tn}, or the convolution of the  twist-3 T-odd DF $f^\perp$ with the unpolarized FF $D_1$\cite{Metz:2004je}.
Because the $f^\perp$ DF can be interpreted as the higher-twist analog of the Sivers function, it underscores the potential of $\cos\phi_h$ modulation for studying spin-orbit correlations.

\textbf{III. EXPERIMENT AND ANALYSIS} \par
\end{center}
Longitudinally polarized electrons were scattered off an unpolarized liquid-hydrogen target. 
Scattered electrons were detected in CLAS.
Electron candidates were selected by a hardware trigger using a coincidence of the gas Cherenkov counters and the lead-scintillator electromagnetic calorimeters. 

Deep-inelastic scattering events were selected by requiring $Q^2>1$ GeV$^2$ and  $W^2>4$ GeV$^2$,
where $W$ is the invariant mass of the hadronic final state. 
The total number of selected $e\pi^\pm$ coincidences was $\approx 6.7M$ for the $z$ range $0.4<z<0.7$, which selects the semi-inclusive region \cite{Avakian:2010ae}.
Events with missing-mass values for the $e\pi^\pm$ system that are smaller 
than 1.35 GeV ($M_{X}(e\pi^\pm)<$1.35 GeV) were discarded to exclude contributions from exclusive processes. 
In pion SIDIS events ($ep \rightarrow e\pi X$), the missing mass ($M_X$) is defined as the invariant mass of the undetected state $X$:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:missingMassDefinition}
M_X^2 = \left( P + q - P_h \right)^2.
\end{equation}

Figure~\ref{fig:pipMissingMassCut} shows the $M_X$ distribution for candidate $ep \rightarrow e\pi^\pm X$ events.
Events with $M_X < 1.35$ GeV are cut.
This cut helps to remove proton contamination at high momenta in $\pi^+$ sample, and also cuts out exclusive events ($ep \rightarrow e\pi^+ n$) (the peak near the nucleon mass 0.938 GeV in figure~\ref{fig:pipMissingMassCut}) and the delta resonance (the peak near 1.2 GeV in figure~\ref{fig:pipMissingMassCut}), both of which are not desirable for a SIDIS sample anyway.

A major challenge in extraction of $\phi_h$ distributions is the handling of the detector acceptance, both geometrical acceptance (the location of active detector elements) and the efficiency in the active regions.
This is done using Monte Carlo simulations.
A LUND-MC based event generator, PEPSI~\cite{Mankiewicz:1991dp}, was used to create a realistic large set of events (several iterations were done to make the set ``realistic'') which were passed through a GEANT based simulation of the CLAS detector.
Figure~\ref{fig:pt2_data_mc_comparison} shows a comparison between the $P_{h\perp}^2$ distributions measured in this work and the distribution predicted by a GEANT simulation.
For a given kinematic bin, the acceptance is equal to the number of reconstructed events divided by the number of generated events.
The number of events in the experimental data is then divided by the acceptance to get a corrected value for the number of events.
After events have been selected and binned, and after all corrections including energy loss corrections, acceptance, radiative, and bin centering corrections have been applied, 
a table of values of counts in elementary bins has been extracted in 5-dimensional $x$, $Q^2$, $z$, $\Phperp^2$, and $\phi_h$ phase space.
The aforementioned bin centering corrections adjust for bin size and the fact that the measured cross-section is averaged over the phase space coverage of each bin.
\begin{figure}[htp]

\label{fig:pt2_data_mc_comparison}
\end{figure}


HAPRAD version 2.0 \cite{Akushevich:1999hz,Akushevich:2007jc} was used to calculate radiative corrections (RC) for each bin by calculating $\sigma_{rad+tail} \left( x, Q^2, z, P_{h\perp}^2, \phi_h \right)$ for a given \allowbreak $\sigma_{Born} \left( x, Q^2, z, P_{h\perp}^2, \phi_h \right)$ which is obtained from a model.
The radiative correction factor is then simply
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\label{eq:RCfactor}
& RC\ factor \left( x, Q^2, z, P_{h\perp}^2, \phi_h \right) =
\\
& \frac{\sigma_{rad+tail} \left( x, Q^2, z, P_{h\perp}^2, \phi_h \right)}{\sigma_{Born} \left( x, Q^2, z, P_{h\perp}^2, \phi_h \right)}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
and the Born cross-section can be obtained by dividing the measured cross-section by the RC factor, i.e., $\sigma_{Born} = \sigma_{measured}/\text{RC factor}$.
Three different models were used to study model dependence of radiative corrections.
The first model came from MAID 2003~\cite{Drechsel:1999}, which was then tuned slightly to better match the data to produce the other two models.

Fourteen sources of systematic error were studied - eight from electron selection cuts, three from pion selection cuts, one from the acceptance model, one from the RC model, and one from sector dependence.
The systematic error on the final result due to a given source is the RMS of the deviations of the modified result from the original, i.e. the error from source $i$ is
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:RMS}
\Delta_{RMS}^i = \frac{\sqrt{\sum_j^{N_v^i} \Delta_j^2}}{\sqrt{N_v^i}}
\end{equation}
%
where $\Delta_j$ is the difference between the final result with the nominal value and the final result with variation $j$, and $N_v^i$ is the number of variations for source $i$.
Dominant sources of systematic error include the acceptance, electron selection cuts, and variations between the six sectors of CLAS.
Table~\ref{tab:A0AcAcc_PT2bins_x1QQ1z8} breaks down the relative sizes of the errors for each source for several representative bins.
Typically, the size of the systematic errors is comparable to the size of the statistical errors.
Relatively large systematic errors occur in regions of phase space where the acceptance changes rapidly.
This acceptance structure is strongly correlated with $z$ and $P_{h\perp}^2$ as shown in figure~\ref{fig:A0AcAcc_zPT2bins_x1QQ1_final}.

\textbf{A. $A_0$, $A_{UU}^{\cos\phi_h}$, and $A_{UU}^{\cos 2\phi_h}$} \par
\end{center}
To extract the $\phi_h$-independent term ($A_0$) and azimuthal moments ($A_{UU}^{\cos\phi_h}$ and $A_{UU}^{\cos 2\phi_h}$), the $\phi_h$ distributions for charged pions for each $x$, $Q^2$, $z$, and $P_{h\perp}^2$ bin are fit with the function $a(1 + b\cos\phi_h + c\cos 2\phi_h)$.
The parameters $a$, $b$, and $c$ then directly give $A_0$, $A_{UU}^{\cos\phi_h}$, and $A_{UU}^{\cos 2\phi_h}$ for each $x$, $Q^2$, $z$, and $P_{h\perp}^2$ bin.
Comparing this to equation~\ref{eq:crosssection3} gives
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:A0AcAccDefinitions}
\begin{split}
& A_0 = \frac{2\pi}{2(k\cdot P)x} \frac{\alpha^{2}}{xyQ^{2}} \frac{y^{2}}{2 \left( 1 - \varepsilon \right)} \left( 1 + \frac{\gamma^{2}}{2x} \right) \left( F_{UU,T} + \varepsilon F_{UU,L} \right)
\\
& A_{UU}^{\cos \phi_h} = \frac{\sqrt{2 \varepsilon \left( 1 + \varepsilon \right)} F_{UU}^{\cos \phi_h}}{F_{UU,T} + \varepsilon F_{UU,L}}
\\
& A_{UU}^{\cos 2 \phi_h} = \frac{\varepsilon F_{UU}^{\cos 2 \phi_h}}{F_{UU,T} + \varepsilon F_{UU,L}} .
\end{split}
\end{equation}

The $\cos \phi_h$ modulations for $\pi^+$ and $\pi^-$ differ considerably, sometimes with opposite signs indicating the Boer-Mulders effect in cosine modulations at lower energies plays a more significant role than expected from higher energy measurements.
A possible suppression of the Cahn effect due to phase space limitations, which play a more important role at lower beam energies, has been discussed by Boglione et al~\cite{Boglione:2011wm}.

The measured $\cos 2 \phi_h$ moment for $\pi^+$ and $\pi^-$ in most of the kinematic bins are close to each other indicating the contribution from the Boer-Mulders effect may not be dominant.
The $\cos \phi_h$ asymmetry gets contributions only at sub-leading twist and can be used to constrain the related terms~\cite{Cahn:1978se,Anselmino:2005nn,Berger:1979xz}.
%The formalism based on the twist-3 approach could be tested in $Q^2$ dependence of $\cos\phi_h$ modulations.

\textbf{B. Comparisons} \par
\end{center}

During the last few years several precise SIDIS measurements have become available. The CLAS
collaboration measured non-zero cosine modulations for positive pions produced
by 6 GeV/c electrons scattering off the proton~\cite{Osipenko:2008rv}.  The
HERMES experiment have measured cosine modulations of hadrons produced in the
scattering of 27.5 GeV/c electrons and positrons off pure hydrogen and deuterium
targets, where the lepton beam scatters directly off neutrons and protons (with
only negligible nuclear effects in case of
deuterium)~\cite{Airapetian:2012yg}. For the first time these modulations were
determined in a four-dimensional kinematic space for positively and negatively
charged pions.
At COMPASS, positive and negative hadrons produced by the 160 GeV/c muon beam
scattering off a $\rm ^6LiD$ target have been measured in a three-dimensional
grid of the relevant kinematic variables $x$, $z$ and
$\Phperp$~\cite{Adolph:2014pwc}.

In all the experiments, the new data confirm the existence of a sizable
$\cos\phi_h$ and a non-zero $\cos2\phi_h$ modulations.  However, the results
published by different experiments are not fully consistent. For example,
positive $\cos2\phi_h$ amplitudes for both positively and negatively charged
hadrons were measured at COMPASS, while at HERMES, positive $\cos 2\phi_h$ amplitudes
were extracted for negatively charged pions, while for positively charged pions
the moments are compatible with zero, but tend to be negative in some kinematic
regions. In all the cases, the amplitudes of the cosine modulations show strong
kinematic dependencies. 
The $\cos2\phi_h$ modulation of positive hadrons in two experiments, while showing similar behaviour are significantly different, in particular at relatively large $\Phperp$  ($\Phperp>0.5$ GeV$/c$).
Opposite-charge pion signals show unexpected large differences which can be related to the peculiar flavor dependence of the Collins function entering the Boer-Mulders term~\cite{Airapetian:2012yg}. Disagreements are typically much bigger for integrated bins, indicating that for 
more complete and fair comparison between results and between results
and theoretical models, a fully differential analysis, using the complete
multi-dimensional information is required.

A similar measurement has been published by the CLAS Collaboration using a different dataset~\cite{Osipenko:2008rv}.
However, it only measures $\pi^+$ production and has a more limited kinematic range.
A comparison for $\pi^+$ production in overlapping kinematic ranges is done here.
In order to have a meaningful comparison, the binning scheme used here was temporarily changed to match that of~\cite{Osipenko:2008rv}.
Figure~\ref{fig:osipenkoComparisonVPT2_2zBins} shows the comparison between this analysis (red up-triangles) and the previous CLAS results (blue down-triangles) as a function of $\Phperp^2$ for two $z$ bins ($0.29 < z < 0.32$ (left column) and $0.32 < z < 0.35$ (right column)) for $\pi^+$ production.
The results agree within error bars implying good consistency between measurements.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:clas-hermes}, CLAS measurements are compared with corresponding measurements from HERMES experiment~\cite{Airapetian:2012yg}.
After taking into account the kinematic factors in the expression
of the $\cos\phi_h$ modulation and $\phi_h$ independent terms (\cite{Bacchetta:2006tn})
\begin{eqnarray}
%f(y)\approx \frac{(2-y)\sqrt{1-y}}{1-y+y^{2}/2} ,
f(y) = \frac{(2-y)\sqrt{1-y-\gamma^2y^2/4}}{1-y+y^{2}/2+\gamma^2y^2/4} ,
\label{fy}
\end{eqnarray}
the CLAS and HERMES measurements are found to 
be consistent with each other in a wide range of $Q^2$, as shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:clas-hermes}, indicating that at energies as low as 5-6 GeV, the
behavior of azimuthal modulations are similar to higher energy measurements. 
For comparison, the lowest $\xbj$ CLAS bin and highest $\xbj$ HERMES bins were used with equal average value of $\xbj\approx$ 0.19, $z\approx$ 0.45 and $\Phperp^2 \approx$ 0.42 GeV$^2$;
the $Q^2$ range for CLAS is 1.0 - 1.5 $\text{GeV}^2$ while the $Q^2$ range for HERMES is 3.5 - 8.0 $\text{GeV}^2$.

The CLAS data show good agreement of azimuthal moments for the kinematic region where the two data sets overlap with comparable or better precision, and they extend the measurements to the large $\xbj$ region not accessible at HERMES.

\textbf{V. SUMMARY} \par
\end{center}
In summary, we have presented measurements of the kinematic dependences of the azimuthal modulations in semi-inclusive $\pi ^\pm$ electroproduction from CLAS as a function of $\xbj$, $Q^2$, $z$, and $\Phperp^2$.
The $\cos \phi_h$ moment shows considerable dependence on the flavor of final state.
The results are compared with published HERMES data~\cite{Airapetian:2012yg} and
show good agreement and can serve as an important input for studies of higher-twist effects.
%The $Q^2$-dependence of the $\cos\phi_h$ modulation is consistent with the twist-3 nature of the contribution and is consistent with measurements performed at much higher energies and $Q^2$.
The $Q^2$-dependence of the $\cos\phi_h$ modulation is consistent with measurements performed at much higher energies and $Q^2$.

%The existence of sizable $\cos\phi_h$ modulations and non-zero $\cos 2 \phi_h$ modulations suggest that the Boer-Mulders function is non-zero.
The existence of flavor dependence in sizable $\cos\phi_h$ modulations, and non-zero $\cos 2 \phi_h$ modulations suggest that the Boer-Mulders function is non-zero.
This hints at a non-zero quark orbital angular momentum contribution to the proton spin, as a non-zero Boer-Mulders function is a necessary condition for this.
